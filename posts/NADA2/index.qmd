With industrialization, humans have influenced the environment in which they live. We synthesize chemicals for specific uses and extract natural resources with chemical byproducts as waste. Exposure to chemical contaminants is unavoidable; even in environments that appear pristine, man-made chemicals can be detected by laboratory methods. The fields of analytical chemistry and toxicology converge to measure concentrations of chemical contaminants in the environment, in our food, water, and consumer products, and in our bodies, and to assess their associated health effects.

With the backlog of chemical contaminants we are exposed to, many of whose toxicology is unknown, and the thousands of chemicals we encounter in our lives, methods in toxicology have been changing to keep up.^1–3^  However, at its root, effective chemical measurements through laboratory testing are needed to assess risk. Each method for measuring chemical concentrations has a lower limit, below which the instrument is not sensitive enough to detect true differences in concentrations. Common practice in environmental monitoring is to impute observations below the detection limit (\<DL) to either 1 × DL or 1/2 × DL. This has traditionally been practical and was an accepted bias in summary statistics used in chemical evaluation, but it does not incorporate modern methods for handling censored data based on probability and distributional data. This leads to bias in summary statistics used in chemical evaluation.

Environmental chemistry typically follows a log-normal distribution,^4^ i.e., a right-skewed distribution, because of a few high-concentration observations relative to the majority of the dataset. Replacing the \<DL values with a constant cuts off the lower tail of the distribution, as shown in Figure 1. This is known as left-censored data.

NADA2 is an R package that provides additional tools to handle censored data.^5^ It incorporates the distribution of the data and provides a range of likely values to replace \<DL with, giving a more realistic prediction of the true chemical concentrations.

This is needed because some chemical contaminants have very low recommended safe doses that are approaching the detection limit of our best laboratory methods. As a result, small biases in our imputed values, which may be minor when chemical concentrations are well above the detection limit, can have a much greater impact as measured concentrations approach the detection limit. Incorporating the NADA2 toolkit will improve summary statistics and inference for environmental safety assessments.
